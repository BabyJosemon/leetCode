this can be solved with the idea that all anagrams of a word have the same string of words when their constituent letters are put in ascending order. Eg."nat" and "tan" are anagrams that should come together and the unique thing about them is that the word formed by ascending order of their constituents is "ant". Similarly for "ate", "eat","tea" their common word is "aet". So we create a hashmap and for each word scanned, we find this common word and this common word becomes key and a list of the word scanned becomes the value. At last we just return the values.
