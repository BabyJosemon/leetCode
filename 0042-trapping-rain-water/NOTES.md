At each point, note that the water height can only be a minimum of the maximum height on left side and maximum height on right side. From this we subtract the elevation. After subtracting the elevation if there is a positive number left, that is the amount of water in that gap.
Eg.
consider height[2]=0, at this point the maximum height to its left is 1(height[1]) and maximum height to the right is 3(height[[7]). The minimum of these is 1, that means at most this gap can hold 1 unit of water. Subtract the current elevation(height[2]) from this water to get 1-0=1 unit of water in this space.
Eg. consider height[5]=0, max on left=2, right=3. Min of this is 2. Subtracting elevation 2-0=2 units of water
Eg. height[8]=2, maxL=3 maxR=2. Min of that is 2. Subtracting elevation (2) from it we get 2-2=0, so cannot hold water.
Eg. height[7]=3, maxL2=2, maxR=2.Min of that is 2. Subtracting elevation(3) from it we get 2-3=-1 which is negative so cannot hold water.

An easy way to use this technique is to create 2 new arrays arrMaxLeft[] and arrMaxRight[] of size n. arrMaxLeft[] would hold at each point the highest height seen to the left of the current position and vice versa in arrMaxRight[]. Then we just subtract height[] values from min of respective arrMaxLeft[] and arrMaxRight[] arrays. We only add it to result if it is greater than 0.
