Here we will use bucket sort, we create a frequency distribution eg.{1:3,2:2,3:1} then we create a bucket list that will store the key in the bucketList[freq[key]] position. This means that 1 will be stored in index 3, 2 at index 2, and 3 at index 1. This is also why the bucket list will have size nums.length+1 as the length will be limited to the max frequency. Then we just retrieve k values from the back of the bucketList. Each element of the bucketList is made a list so that if we have values with same frequency then they need to be accounted for as well.
